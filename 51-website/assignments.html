<h3>Problem set grading standards summary (subject to modification for future assignments):</h3>
<p>Submissions are graded according to the following guidelines:
<p><u>5-point submissions</u>: all code is correct except for possibly one <b>very</b> minor mistake. Style is universally clean and careful except for possibly a couple of minor style issues or up to one larger style issue.
<p><u>4-point submissions</u>: no more than two total "mistakes", where a mistake is defined as incorrect code in some part of a function or two style issues.
<p><u>3-point submissions</u>: the midpoint of the scale, a 3-point submission is defined by being better than a 2-point submission, but not up to the standards of a 4-point submission (i.e., it exhibits more than two of the issues mentioned above). In general, such submissions will have entirely correct code in the majority of the exercises, but errors of both correctness and style scattered throughout.
<p><u>2-point submissions</u>: almost all functions have some correct cases, but almost all functions contain some mistakes.
<p><u>1-point submissions</u>: many exercises not attempted and/or the majority of exercises have incorrect behavior on most inputs.

<p>Note in particular that 5-point submissions will be rare. A very good submission is likely to earn a 4; a fairly good submission is likely a 3.
