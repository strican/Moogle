    <h1>CSCI E-250 Problem Set 1: Introduction to OCaml</h1>
    <h3 align="left"> Due Sunday, February 7, 2010, 11:59 pm.</h3>

	<a href="..">Back to CSCI E-250 Home</a>
    <hr>
    <h3>Instructions</h3> <p> This problem set contains some exercises
      to introduce you to OCaml (and, more generally, to many of the ideas
      underlying statically-typed functional languages).
      First, you should download the <a href="ps1.tgz">assignment tarball</a>,
      and extract it by saving it somewhere and running <code> tar -xzf ps1.tgz</code> (or using your favorite GUI program such as <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a>).
      Within, you will find a solution template (<tt>ps1.ml</tt>)
      that contains a commented-out stub for each function you are asked to implement;
      you should uncomment them as you fill in your solutions.
    </p>

    <h3>Important notes</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Compile errors:</b>
        Your solution <em>must compile</em>.
        If you omit problems, leave the corresponding definitions commented out
        so that they will not confuse our automated grader as it checks the other problems.
        If you are having difficulty getting your code to compile,
        please visit office hours.

      <li><b>Magic and its order:</b>
        You may encounter comments in our template files of the form: <br/>
        <center><code>(*>* Some text here *>*)</code></center>
        These are magical incantations to our automated grader.
        Please leave them intact, and make sure to insert your code at the
        appropriate point in the file (relative to the magic).
        Do not remove magic, even if you omit problems.
        If your solutions are out of order, and/or you modify/add/remove magic,
        we will probably have to test your code manually,
        which will make us sad.
      </li>

      <li><b>Testing:</b>
        Don't wait for our automated grader to point out bugs in your code;
        test it yourself!
        OCaml's static type system catches a lot of errors, but not all of them.
        Thorough testing will not only help you avoid making mistakes,
        but will also help you evaluate your design choices
        (notably, short functions with conceptually clear roles
        are much easier to test).
      </li>

      <li><b>Auxiliary functions:</b>
        Feel free to use them when they make your code cleaner,
        more modular, and/or easier to test &mdash;
        that's what functions are for!
        Just make sure that if we name a particular function that you have to write
        (either in the assignment text, or in a template file),
        that you preserve its name
        so that our automated grader can find it.
      </li>

      <li><b>Style:</b>
        Finally, please pay attention to style.
        Take the extra time to think about
        the problems and find the most elegant solutions before coding them up.
        Even though only the second problem (below) explicitly addresses
        the style issue, good style is important throughout the assignment,
        and indeed the entire course (and In Real Life!).
        For reference,
        you may consult the <a href="../../ocaml_style_guide.html">OCaml style guide</a>
        and the <a href="../../lectures.html">lecture notes</a>,
        and you are also encouraged to bring style questions to the TFs at office hours.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Problem 1: Fun With Types</h3>
    <p> Give the type of each of the following OCaml expressions.
      For example, the type of <code>(1, 2)</code> is <code>int * int</code>.</p>

    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <code>[("CS", 50); ("CS", 51)]</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>(fun (x, y) -> x *. y) (4.0, 5.0)</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>(<a href = "http://ocaml-lib.sourceforge.net/doc/Option.html">Some</a> 123, <a href = "http://ocaml-lib.sourceforge.net/doc/Option.html">None</a>)</code>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <span style="font-family: Courier New; background-color: #bddddd"></span>

    <p>
      Give expressions that have the following types:</p>

    <ol type="a" start="4">
      <li>
        <code>((int * float) list * string) list </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>(float -> float -> float) * (int * int -> int)</code>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Replace <code>???</code> with an expression that makes the code
      type-check correctly.  You might start by adding types to the
      declarations.</p>
    <ol type="a" start="6">
      <li>
        <pre>
          let rec foo bar =
          match bar with
          | ((a, b), c) :: xs -> a * (b + c + (foo xs))
          | _ -> 1
          in foo (???)
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <pre>
	  let v = (32.0, 28.0) in
	  let square x = x *. x in
	  let squared_norm (w:float * float) : float = ??? in
	  let d = sqrt (squared_norm v) in
	  int_of_float d
        </pre>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Problem 2: Style Emergency</h3>
    <p>The following function is computationally correct, but it was written with poor style.
      You may want to consult the <a href="../ocaml_style_guide.html">OCaml
        style guide</a>. Rewrite this function using pattern matching, so
      that it does the same thing, but with style.  You may not use the
      standard library function <code>List.merge</code> for this problem.
    </p>

    <pre>
      let rec merge (a: int list) (b: int list) : int list =
      if (List.length a) = 0 && (List.length b) = 0 then b
      else if (List.length b) = 0 then a
      else if (List.length a) = 0 then b
      else if (List.hd(a) < List.hd(b)) = true then [List.hd a]
                            @ (merge (List.tl a) b) else [List.hd b] @ (merge a (List.tl b))
                            </pre>

    <h3>Problem 3: A Series of Tasks</h3>
    <p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p>
            Write a function <code>sorted : int list -> bool</code> that
returns true if the items in the list are in non-descending
order. The empty list is considered to be sorted.
</p>
<p>For example, <code>sorted [1; 1; 2; 4] = true</code> and <code>sorted [1; 2; 3; 1] = false</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>Write a function <code>partition : int list -> int -> int list * int list</code>
	that takes an <code>int list</code> and returns a tuple <code>(less,
      greater)</code> where <code>less</code> is a list containing
    all the values from the given list that are less than or
    equal to the given integer, and <code>greater</code> is a list of all the values
    greater than the given integer.  If a value appears multiple times in
    the input list, then it should appear the same number of times in one of the 
    returned lists.  You should <em>not</em> assume the input list is sorted,
	and you should ensure that you return the partitioned elements of
	each list in the same order as they appeared in the input list.  For example, <code>partition [1;3;6;2;5] 3 = ([1;3;2], [6;5])</code>. 
</li>
<li>
  <p>Write a function
    <code>unzip : (int * int) list -> int list * int list</code>
    which, given a list of pairs, returns a pair of lists, the first
    of which contains each first element of each pair, and the second
    of which contains each second element.  The returned lists should
    have the elements in the order that they appeared in the input.
    So, for instance,
    <code>unzip [(1,2);(3,4);(5,6)] = ([1;3;5],[2;4;6])</code>.
</li>
<li>
  Write a function <code>variance : float list -> float option</code>
  that returns the <a href = "http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SampleVariance.html">sample variance</a>
  of the numbers in its input list, if
  the list has at least two elements
  (otherwise, it should return <code>None</code>).
  On an input list (containing at least two elements),
  the sample variance is defined to be <img src = "variance.gif" align = "middle"><!--\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}^{N-1}{(x_i - m)^2}--> where x<sub>i</sub> is the <i>i</i>th value of the input list,
  <i>N</i> is the number of values in the input list, and <i>m</i> is the arithmetic mean: <!-- \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}^{N}x_i --> 
  <img src = "mean.gif" align = "middle">.  For example,
  <code>variance [1.0; 2.0; 3.0; 4.0; 5.0] = Some 2.5</code>,
  while <code>variance [1.0] = None</code> and <code>variance [] = None</code>.
  Remember to use the floating point version of the arithmetic operators when operating on floats (i.e. use <code>+.</code>, <code>*.</code>, and <code>/.</code> instead of <code>+</code>,
  <code>*</code>, and <code>/</code>)</code>.  You can use the <code>float</code> function to cast an <code>int</code> to a <code>float</code>.
</li><br/>
<li>
  <p>Write a function <code>perfect : int -> bool</code> that returns
    true if its input is a <a href =
                              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number">perfect number</a>. A
    perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its
    positive divisors except itself.</p>
  <p>For example, <code>perfect 6 = true</code> and <code>perfect 100 = false</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <b>Challenge</b> (<em>for karma, not for credit &mdash;
	but you're encouraged to at least attempt it, since it contains some cool ideas</em>):
  Write a function <code>permutations : int list -> int list list</code> such that <code>permutations lst</code> returns a list containing every
  permutation of <code>lst</code>.  For example, one correct answer to <code>permutations [1;
	2; 3]</code> is <code>[[1; 2; 3]; [2; 1; 3]; [2; 3; 1]; [1; 3; 2];
	[3; 1; 2]; [3; 2; 1]]</code>.  It doesn't matter what order the
  permutations appear in the returned list.  Note that if the input
  list is of length <code>n</code> then the answer should be of length
  <code>n!</code>.

  <br/><br/>
  <b>Hint:</b>
  One way to do this is to write an auxiliary function,
  <code>interleave : int -> int list -> int list list</code>,
  that yields all interleavings of its first argument into its second:
  <code>interleave 1 [2;3] = [ [1;2;3]; [2;1;3]; [2;3;1] ]</code>.
  You may also find occasion for the library functions
  <code>List.map</code>
  and <code>List.concat</code>.

</li>
</ol>
