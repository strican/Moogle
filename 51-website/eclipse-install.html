<h3>Installing Eclipse with a plugin for writing Ocaml code</h3>
<ol>
<li> Download Eclipse: download the "for Java Developers" version from
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a>.  If you already have Eclipse,
ensure that you are running version 3.5.  Note that Eclipse does not
have an installer; it is just a self-contained application (so you may
want to move the unzipped folder into a place you'll remember).
<li> Follow the exact instructions on the "Installation" section of
the Install page of <a href="http://www.algo-prog.info/ocaide/">http://www.algo-prog.info/ocaide/</a> to install the
OcaIDE plugin for Eclipse.
<li> Restart Eclipse as directed.
</ol>

<h3>Getting started with Eclipse/OcaIDE</h3>

<ol>
<li> In Eclipse, select Window -> Preferences.  Expand OcaIDE, and
click paths.  If the paths have not automatically been populated with
executable files in the folder in which you installed Ocaml, browse
for the files manually.  Otherwise, keep these defaults.
<li> Select Window -> Open Perspective -> Other.  Select Ocaml from
the list and click OK.
<li> Select File -> New -> Ocaml Managed Project (not "Ocaml Project
(ocamlbuild)").  Give your project a name.
<li> You should see your new project in the Navigator pane on the
left.  Right click on the project name, and select New->Module.  This
will be your Ocaml source file.  Give it a name with no special
characters and without a file extension (the .ml will be added
automatically).
<li> You should now see this file in the editor window.  Starting
typing ML code!
<li> To compile your code, simply save the file.  Click on the
"Problems" tab or "OCaml Compiler Output" tab near the bottom of the
screen to see any errors or warnings that were generated.
<li> All that's left now is to be able to run your code.  To do this,
right click on your module (.ml) file in the Navigator, and select
Properties.  Check the box labelled "Make an executable named:" and
click ok.  Now, after building again, you should see a corresponding
executable file in the Navigator.  Right click on that, and select Run
as -> Ocaml Executable.  Look for the output in a new "Console" tab in
the bottom pane.  That's it!
</ol>
