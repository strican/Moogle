<h1>CS51 Problem Set 0: Getting started</h1>
<h3 align="left"> Due Sun, Jan 31, 2010, 11:59 pm.</h3>
<hr>
Updated Thur, Jan 28 (tweaked setup/Eclipse instructions in response to feedback; no change in assignment)
<br>
<h3>Instructions</h3> <p> The purpose of this assignment is to get you
    set up for the real assignments to come.  You will set up an editing
    environment for Ocaml, make sure you can compile and run some toy
    programs, and figure out the assignment submission system.

<h3>Part 1: Signing up for a bulletin board account</h3>

Go
to <a href="http://forums.seas.harvard.edu/cs51">forums.seas.harvard.edu/cs51</a>,
click Register (top left), and sign up for an account.  If you have
problems with any of the rest of this assignment (or any of the other
assignments), post to this bulletin board.

<h3>Part 2: Installing Ocaml</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ocaml is already installed on the FAS nice servers.  You can use
  it there (run <code>ocaml</code>), but we'd recommend also
  installing it on your own computer.  To do so, download the
  appropriate package for your operating system from
  the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html">Ocaml download
  page</a> and then follow the directions.  Windows users: we recommend first installing the latest release of <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>, and then getting the "MinGW-based" port of Ocaml (listed first on the Ocaml download page).

<li>
  To test that you can get Ocaml working on the FAS machines, use SSH to
  login to <code>nice.fas.harvard.edu</code>: 
  <ul>
    <li>From a terminal,
      type <code>ssh userid@nice.fas.harvard.edu</code>, using the
      correct <code>userid</code> of course.
    <li>From a graphical ssh client, follow the directions :)
  </ul>
  Now run <code>ocaml</code>.
<li>To test locally, just run <code>ocaml</code> from a terminal 
("Command Prompt" in Windows).


Whether you're running on the server or locally, you should now see
  the Ocaml prompt:
<pre>
$ ocaml
        Objective Caml version 3.11.1

#
</pre>
  <p>If you type 

<pre>
"are we there yet?";;
</pre>
you should get the output:
<pre>
- : string = "are we there yet?"
</pre>
<p>Congratulations!  If you got this far, Ocaml works.  Type 
<pre>
#quit;;
</pre>
or Ctrl-D to exit Ocaml. Now you just have to learn how to write useful programs.
<li>
If you prefer not to use a terminal-based text editor to complete your work, we have also provided <a href="../ocaml-install.html">instructions for getting
  OCaml running in Eclipse</a>, 
which is a free IDE that will also work for Java.

</ul>

<h3>Part 3: Downloading the code and filling out the survey </h3>

<p>
<a href="ps0.tgz">Click here</a> to
download <code>ps0.tgz</code>.  Save it somewhere, run <code>tar -xzf
  ps0.tgz</code> to unzip it (or use your favorite GUI program like
winzip). As above, you can work on nice.fas or locally on your computer. 
Save and unzip the file where you intend to do your work.

<p>
You should now have a directory with a <code>ps0.ml</code> file
inside.  <b>Your job is to edit this file</b>, setting all the
variables to appropriate values.  

<p>
<i>If you are using Eclipse</i>, you will have to create a new Ocaml 
Managed Project (see instructions above for using Eclipse) for PS0. Copy 
the files you downloaded and unzipped into the folder Eclipse creates 
for your new project.  From within Eclipse, select File -> Refresh.  You should now see the ps0 files added to your Eclipse project, in the Navigator pane.  You can then edit ps0.ml by double clicking it.

<p>
Once you're done, make sure the file still compiles: if you're using
Eclipse, use the instructions for that.  If you're using emacs, use
the provided Makefile by typing <code>make</code> in
the <code>ps0</code> directory:

<pre>
$ make
ocamlc -o survey ps0.ml

$ ./survey

</pre>

<p>
Check that the values are all filled in correctly.  Once they are,
you just have to submit.

<h3>Part 4: Submitting</h3>

<p>
To submit the assignment, your assignment directory must be on nice.fas.
If you were working on your computer, upload the directory 
containing ps0.ml and the other downloaded files to nice. To upload, you'll need an FTP client
(see <a href="../ocaml-install.html">instructions page</a>, under "Uploading your work to nice").

<p>
Run <code>make 
submit</code>.  You should get
output like the following:

<p>
<pre>
$ % make submit
./submit.sh
Ok, submitting the files in /home/s/h/shnayder/release/ps0-submit
Creating temporary directory /tmp/shnayder.submit...
Copying assignment files to /tmp/shnayder.submit...
Submitting lib51 assignment 0... Done!
Temporary files removed.

Done!
$ 
</pre>

<p>If you've submitted successfully, you're done!
