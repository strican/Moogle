<p><h3>Installing OCaml, Java and dependencies</h3>
<ol>
<li> Windows only: Install the latest version of <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>.
<li> Download and install the latest release of <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/release.en.html">Objective Caml</a> for
your operating system.  Windows users should get the "MinGW-based"
port (listed first), some of whose features require Cygwin.<br>
  <b>NOTE:</b> It looks like some people are having trouble with
  version 3.11.2 on OS X.
  Try <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.11/ocaml-3.11.1-intel.dmg">3.11.1</a>
  instead if 3.11.2 doesn't work.
<li> Make sure that you are running either version 1.5 or version 1.6
of the Java Virtual Machine.  If you don't know, go to
<a href="http://java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml">http://java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml</a>.  If your setup is
correct, your version will show up as either Java 5 or Java 6.  If
needed, the latest JVM can be downloaded from
<a href="http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp">http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp</a>
</ol>

<h3>Choose your editor</h3>

<h3>Using the Ocaml toplevel</h3>

<p>Ocaml gives you a way to interact with code that you've written called
a "Toplevel" (read more about toplevels at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop</a>). If you're using 
Emacs with tuareg-mode, you can easily enter the toplevel (see 
<a href="emacs-install.html">Emacs instructions</a>). Once we get to
using modules, we'll show you a way to do this within Eclipse/OcaIDE.
For now, you can simply open up the program "Objective Caml" that was
installed in step 2, and either (1) File -> Open the .ml file containing 
your code, or (2) copy and paste your code from Eclipse and hit enter. 
Now you'll be able to interact with the code that you have pasted in.

<h3>Uploading your work to nice</h3>

<p><em>Windows users:</em> Download and install <a href="http://winscp.net/eng/download.php">WinSCP</a>, 
an FTP client for Windows. Run WinSCP and login to your nice account. You can now drag and drop
your local files (left panel) to your nice account (right panel), and
vice versa.
<p>
  <em>Mac/Linux users:</em> You can just use the command
  line <code>scp</code>, or find one of the many GUI versions.  From
  the command line:

<pre>
$ scp -r ps0/ userid@nice.fas.harvard.edu:~/
</pre>
