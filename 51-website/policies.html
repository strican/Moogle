<h2 class="header">CS51 General Course Requirements </h2>

<a href="index.html">CS51 Home</a>

<p>The course requirements include 7 problem sets, 1 small project, 1
  large project, 1 midterm exam and 1 final exam.  There will also be
  several easy quizzes in section; the purpose of these is to make
  sure no one is falling too far behind. Problem sets are due Friday
  at 5pm every week, except for weeks with an exam. Please note that
  problem sets may not be weighted equally.  Both exams will be closed
  book.

<p>The breakdown for final grades is as follows:
<ul>
<li>30% problem sets
<li>5% quizzes
<li>10% first project
<li>20% second project
<li>15% midterm
<li>20% final
</ul>

<h2>Sections </h2>

<p>There are weekly sections with our Teaching Fellows. While sections
   are not mandatory, except for weeks when there's a quiz, they are
   highly encouraged, and will be very helpful for both reinforcing
   the material and completing the problem sets. Students who don't
   attend sections often have trouble completing the problem sets. You
   should attend the section of your TF.  If you have a one time
   conflict, email your TF and the TF of the section you'd like to go
   to instead.  If you have a repeated conflict, email the Head TF and
   we'll work on switching you to a different section.

<h2>Office Hours</h2>

<p>There are regular office hours with the TFs in the Terminal Room
(which is in the Science Center basement -- go down the stairs to the
basement and turn left).  Times will be posted on the website.  Office
hours generally are aimed at answering problem set questions, but TFs
will be happy to answer any general questions, too.  Greg will also
hold weekly office hours in his office after class on Tuesdays or
by appointment.

<h2>Assignment Due Dates</h2>

<p>Problem sets will be due at 5pm on Fridays.  You must
electronically submit your assignment by 5pm sharp, otherwise your
assignment will be considered late (see below for late day policy).
Some of the assignments, and both of the projects will require working
in pairs or small groups.  The goal is for all partners to work
together on solving and implementing the problem set. This can enhance
the learning process and reflects the reality of software design in
the real world.  While we will not make exceptions to this policy, we
are here to help you if there are problems.

<h2>Late Days, Penalties and Extensions</h2>

<p>Over the course of the semester, you will have 8 late days to spend on
problem sets and project checkpoints.  If for whatever reason you are
not able to turn in your assignment by the due date, you may use a
late day. This late day will extend the due date exactly 24 hours.
You may use up to 2 late days on any assignment.  Note that late days
are not divisible; as soon as the assignment is 1 minute late, you
must use a full late day. If you are working on a partnered
assignment, then every late day you take will cost each partner one
late day. If you have questions or concerns about anything having to
do with late days, please email the Head TFs.

<p>If you use up all of your late days, you will get a zero on late
  work.  
  
<p>Because of our generous late day policy, we will only give additional
extensions for emergencies, and will need either a note from a doctor
or your Resident Dean.  If this comes up, please email the Head TF.

<h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>

<p>Collaboration is a difficult issue, because we want you to work
together and feel comfortable talking about the problem sets. However,
at the same time, we want to be able to grade your work, and not the
work of your friends.

<p>In the single person assignments, we will allow you to talk about
the problem sets with other students. However, you are not allowed to
talk in terms of pseudocode or real code. In the group programming
assignments, we encourage (expect) you and your partners to design and
implement real code together.  However, you are still expected to not
discuss your code with other groups.

<p>
We think that this is a simple and clear policy, and there should be
no question about what things are crossing the line. We run automatic
software to compare the students' assignments, both with this year's
students and the students from past years. If we detect cheating, we
will not hesistate to bring it to the attention of the university.  If
you get stuck on something that you need to talk about real code for,
the TFs will be happy to talk in terms of real code with you!  If you
have any questions, please contact your TF or the Head TF and we would
be happy to clarify.

<h2>Partner Policy</h2>

<p>Throughout the course, there will be several pair or small group
assignments. We expect you to work well as a team, and complete your
assignments together. We understand that this can be hard, but we also
expect all partners to make an effort to do this. If there are cases
in which some partners is trying hard to make the partnership work,
and a partner is not making an effort, we reserve the right to deduct
from the partner causing problems. We rarely have to do this, but if
you are unwilling to work with other people, we will not hesitate to
deduct substantial points, depending on the severity of the
problem. If you have specific concerns about working with other
people, please discuss them with the Head TF before the partnered
assignments start.

For a good explanation of the benefits of pair programming, please read
<a href="docs/Kindergarten.pdf">this</a> paper with your partner the first
time you get together.

<h2>Regrade Policy</h2>

<p>
Any grading disputes besides simple arithmetic errors have to go to
the Head TF.  The work in question will be regraded fully, and the
grade may go up or down.

<h2>Assignment Style</h2>
